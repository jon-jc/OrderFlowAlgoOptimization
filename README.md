Data Conversion Usage
1. Clone the repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/order-flow-trading-strategy.git
cd order-flow-trading-strategy
2. Run the Data Converter
Ensure your .scid and .depth files are in the /data folder, or specify a different directory.

bash
Copy code
python convert_sierra_data.py data/
This will convert all .scid and .depth files in the /data folder into Parquet format.

Example Output:

vbnet
Copy code
Processing files in directory: data/
Converted mnq_level1.scid to mnq_level1.parquet
Converted mnq_level2.depth to mnq_level2.parquet
Conversion complete!
Advanced Trading Strategy
Once your data is converted to Parquet, you can use the order_flow_strategy.ipynb notebook to apply advanced analysis and trading techniques.

1. Open the Jupyter notebook
bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook order_flow_strategy.ipynb
2. Strategy Components
The notebook includes the following:

Load Level 1 and Level 2 Data: Load your Parquet files into pandas DataFrames.
Order Book Imbalance: Calculate bid-ask imbalances and generate signals.
Market Regime Detection: Use Hidden Markov Models to detect different market conditions.
Machine Learning Signal Generation: Train a Random Forest classifier on historical data and generate buy/sell signals.
Risk Management: Apply the Kelly Criterion for dynamic position sizing and stop-loss levels.
3. Customization
You can customize the strategy by adjusting:

Lookback windows for order book imbalance and market regimes.
Number of levels to analyze in the order book.
Machine learning parameters such as the number of estimators in the Random Forest classifier.
Example Strategy Output
After running the notebook, you can expect outputs like:

Buy/Sell Signals based on Level 1 and Level 2 data.
Market Regime Detection (bullish, bearish, sideways).
Performance Metrics: Sharpe Ratio, Total Return, Maximum Drawdown, etc.
Notes
This project assumes you are using Sierra Chartâ€™s Denali feed for data extraction.
The .scid files contain Level 1 data (OHLCV), and .depth files contain Level 2 data (bid/ask).
For large datasets, you may need to implement chunk processing to avoid memory issues.
